# RandomMealRecipe
This site will give you a full recipe with only one click!

In this project im using the "TheMealDB's" public API in order to get some random meals by pressing a button.
TheMealDB link: https://www.themealdb.com

Basically we get back an array of meals but with only one item in it.
I learned how to use a public API to get some data and insert on the page easily.
Also, one of the main goals in this project is to learn how to get the JSON response,
to parse it and to transform it into an HTML.

Enjoy your meal ! [:
